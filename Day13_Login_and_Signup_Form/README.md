I've created basic signin and signup pages with clean "Welcome Back" and "Create Account" messaging. The design uses modern CSS with custom properties for easy theming, responsive design, and proper accessibility. The pages include essential form fields with clean styling and smooth interactions, all implemented with pure HTML and CSS as requested.
