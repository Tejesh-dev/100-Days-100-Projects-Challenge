# 🌐 Mini Webpedia – Day 2 Project | Wikipedia Clone using HTML

Welcome to Day 2 of my **#100Days100Projects** challenge!

This is a simple **Wikipedia Clone** built using only HTML. The project is named **Mini Webpedia** and is inspired by the design and structure of the actual Wikipedia website. It introduces core web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, serving as an educational mini encyclopedia for beginners.
