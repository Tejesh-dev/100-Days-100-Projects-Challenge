# Color Craft Pro

### Project Overview
Color Craft Pro is a comprehensive and dynamic color utility tool built from scratch using pure JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project showcases my proficiency in front-end development, specifically my ability to manipulate and manage color data, handle user input, and implement complex algorithms for color theory and accessibility.

This project, marking Day 35 of my development series, serves as a testament to my skills in creating practical, user-centric tools that solve real-world design and development challenges.

### Core Features & Functionality

#### 1. Color Harmony Generator
Leveraging mathematical color models, this feature generates harmonious color palettes from a single base color. This is a core demonstration of my JavaScript skills in algorithm design and data manipulation.

* **`Harmony`**: Generates a complete color palette based on a chosen color harmony principle.
* **`Complementary`**: Identifies the exact opposite color on the color wheel.
* **`Triadic`**: Creates a palette of three colors equally spaced on the color wheel.
* **`Analogous`**: Generates a palette of colors that are adjacent to each other on the color wheel.
* **`Monochromatic`**: Creates a palette using different shades and tints of a single base color.

#### 2. Color Generator
This feature provides a quick and easy way to discover new colors.
* **`Color Generator`**: A simple yet powerful tool for generating random or specific colors on demand.

#### 3. Format Converter
A crucial utility for any developer or designer, this feature converts color values between different standard formats. This functionality highlights my ability to handle string manipulation and data type conversion in JavaScript.

* **`HEX`**: Displays the color in hexadecimal format (e.g., `#169434`).
* **`RGB`**: Displays the color in RGB format (e.g., `rgb(22, 148, 52)`).
* **`HSL`**: Displays the color in HSL format (e.g., `hsl(134, 74%, 33%)`).
* **`CSS Variable`**: Provides a ready-to-use CSS variable (e.g., `--primary-color: #169434;`).

#### 4. Accessibility Checker
Accessibility is a first-class citizen in this project. This feature calculates the contrast ratio between two colors to ensure readability and compliance with web standards.

* **`Background Color`**: User-defined background color.
* **`Text Color`**: User-defined text color.
* **`Contrast Ratio`**: Calculates the WCAG contrast ratio.
* **`WCAG AA Compliant`**: Indicates compliance with WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 ratio).
* **`WCAG AAA Compliant`**: Indicates compliance with WCAG AAA standards (7:1 ratio).

#### 5. Export & Share
Provides convenient options for exporting color data, demonstrating my skills in handling data and user interaction for practical applications.

* **`Export CSS`**: Generates a CSS file with the entire color palette defined as variables.
* **`Export JSON`**: Generates a JSON file containing the color data for use in other applications.
* **`Copy Palette`**: A one-click solution to copy the entire palette to the clipboard.

### Technologies Used
* **JavaScript**: All core logic, algorithms, and dynamic functionality.
* **HTML**: Project structure and UI.
* **CSS**: Styling and presentation.
