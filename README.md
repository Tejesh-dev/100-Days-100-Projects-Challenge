## Motivation

After completing my MCA, life threw a curveball — I suffered a major leg injury that required surgery, leaving me unable to walk for months.  
Even during recovery, I worked at Reliance Jio as a Customer Care Executive to support myself and my family.  
This phase built my **mental toughness, emotional grit, and resilience**.  

Even while recovering, I never let go of my passion for coding and web development.  
In recent months, I revised my core concepts — **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, Hosting, React, Node.js** — and now I’m ready to turn learning into development.

## The Challenge: 100 Days. 100 Projects. 🚀

For the next 100 days, I’ll be:  
- ✅ Building a new project every day  
- ✅ Sharing clean, open-source code on GitHub  
- ✅ Posting my daily learnings and insights on LinkedIn  

The journey starts with **HTML websites** and gradually moves into:  
- 🎨 CSS layouts & animations  
- ⚙️ JavaScript interactivity & mini apps  
- 🔗 API integration & logic  
- 🧩 Full-stack development using MERN stack  

Each project builds on the last — step by step, project by project — until full-stack mastery is achieved.  

Whether you’re learning alongside me or just looking for inspiration, **everyone is welcome on this journey**.  
Let’s grow, code, and move forward — together. 💻🔥
