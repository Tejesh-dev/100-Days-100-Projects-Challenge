# 🧮 Health Metrics Calculator  

A simple, single-page web application that calculates an individual's **Body Mass Index (BMI)** and their estimated **Daily Calorie Needs (TDEE)**.  

This project is part of my **#100Days100Projects** challenge and was built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

## ✨ Features  
- **BMI Calculation** → Computes BMI based on height and weight  
- **BMI Categorization** → Underweight, Normal, Overweight, Obese (color-coded)  
- **Daily Calorie Needs (TDEE)** → Estimates calories using the **Mifflin-St Jeor equation** (age, gender, activity level)  
- **Responsive Design** → Works on desktop and mobile

## 🛠️ JavaScript Concepts Practiced  
- **DOM Manipulation** → `document.getElementById()` to update UI dynamically  
- **Event Handling** → `addEventListener()` for button clicks  
- **Functions** → Modular functions like `calculateMetrics()` and `clearResults()`  
- **Data Conversion** → Using `parseFloat()` for number inputs  
- **Conditional Logic** → Assigning categories based on BMI

## 💡 My Approach  
I built this app as a **self-contained project** in a single `index.html` file.  
This helped me connect **HTML structure**, **CSS styling**, and **JavaScript logic** in one place, making it easy to prototype and learn.
