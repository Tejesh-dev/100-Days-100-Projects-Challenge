## 📸 Day 8 – Advanced Responsive Grid Gallery

Welcome to **Day 8** of my **100Days100ProjectsChallenge**
In this project, I’ve built a **fully responsive, animated, category-filtered image gallery** using only **HTML**, **CSS**, and **vanilla JavaScript**.

### 🚀 Project Highlights

* 📐 **Responsive Grid Layout** – powered by **CSS Grid**
* 🎨 **Dark Mode Toggle** – theme saved in `localStorage`
* 🗂️ **Filterable Categories** – switch between Nature, Travel, Food, and Architecture
* 🖼️ **Hover Zoom Effect** – smooth scale transitions on images
* 🧩 **Multiple Grid Sizes** – `short`, `medium`, `tall` layouts
* 🎯 **Accessibility** – keyboard-friendly navigation and `alt` texts for SEO
