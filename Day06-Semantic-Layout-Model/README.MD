# ðŸ§± Day 6: Semantic Layout Structure with CSS

This is **Project 6** of my **#100Days100Projects** challenge â€” a practical demonstration of how semantic HTML tags, when combined with CSS, create a clean and professional website layout.

## ðŸ’¡ Purpose

This mini-project showcases the **difference between plain HTML structure and styled layout using CSS**. Itâ€™s designed to visually represent the skeleton of a portfolio-style website using:
- Semantic tags like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>`
- CSS for visual structure, spacing, color, and layout flow

The goal was to **build a template layout** that acts as a **real-world model** for any personal or portfolio website.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

- HTML5 (Semantic Tags)
- CSS (Box Model, Flexbox, Padding, Backgrounds)

## ðŸ“Œ Key Highlights

- Each semantic tag is visually styled to show its placement and importance
- Clean CSS structure to enhance layout
- 4â€“5 image placeholders aligned in a responsive layout
- Fully responsive and intuitive structure

## ðŸš€ Why This Project Matters

> Without CSS, HTML is just structure.  
> Itâ€™s like building a house of bricks without color, decor, or comfort.  
> This project shows how **CSS adds beauty and life** to an HTML-based layout.
