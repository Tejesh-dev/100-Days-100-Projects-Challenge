🚀 Day 5 of #100 Days100 Projects Challenge – Health & Lifestyle Survey Website 

I'm super happy to share my fifth project — a fully functional Survey Website 📝 built using pure HTML, with just a pinch of inline CSS for layout!

🎯 Why this project stands out:

✅ Collects detailed info — personal, educational & wellness-based
✅ Structured with semantic tags like <section>, <fieldset>, <legend>
✅ Engaging video background in the header
✅ All essential form elements — text, radio, checkbox, select, textarea, slider, etc.
✅ 100% responsive using only HTML + minimal inline CSS
✅ No external CSS or JavaScript used!

💡 Purpose: To showcase the power of semantic HTML and form-building before diving into design aesthetics.

🔥 From Day 6, we officially begin CSS!
And this time — we're raising the bar like never before! 💪
Expect beautiful layouts, animation, and interactivity as we go full throttle into modern frontend design. 🎨
