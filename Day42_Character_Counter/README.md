# Day 42 - Character Counter ✍️

## 🔥 Project Overview
This project is part of my **#100Days100Projects** challenge.  
A **Character Counter App** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** that counts characters in real time.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project
- To practice **DOM manipulation** and **event handling** in JavaScript.  
- To understand how to **update UI dynamically** with user input.  
- To implement **input restrictions** and provide feedback to users in real time.

---

## ⚡ Features
- Live character count as user types.  
- Shows **remaining characters** (default limit = 200).  
- **Warning style** when limit is reached.  
- Clean & responsive UI.

---

## 🛠️ JavaScript Concepts Used
- **Event Listeners** (`input` event to track typing).  
- **DOM Manipulation** (`querySelector`, `innerText` updates).  
- **Conditional Styling** (change text color when limit exceeded).  
- **String Properties** (`.length` to count characters).  

---

## 🌍 Real-World Use Cases
- Used in **social media platforms** (Twitter, LinkedIn) where posts have character limits.  
- **Form validations** where input length matters (username, bio, feedback forms).  
- Helps improve **user experience** with real-time feedback.

---

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Add **word counter** along with character count.  
- Provide **customizable limit input**.  
- Store input in **localStorage** to prevent loss on page refresh.
