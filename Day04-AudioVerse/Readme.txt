Project Name: AudioVerse  
Challenge: Day 4 of #100Days100Projects

📌 About the Project

AudioVerse is a simple, interactive music website built using pure HTML. It showcases:

- A featured artist section with links
- A Hindi songs playlist with images, audio players, and download buttons
- A user song suggestion form

While no external or custom CSS files are used, a bit of inline styling is applied for better visual structure. This project demonstrates how powerful plain HTML can be when creatively used.

- 🎤 Featured Artists with YouTube links and profile images
- 🎼 Embedded audio for now playing and playlist
- ⬇️ Downloadable songs and media files
