📅 Day 11/100 – Footer Design Showcase | #100Days100Projects
Today’s project is all about footers — one of the most underestimated yet powerful parts of a website’s design.

I’ve built a showcase of 15+ brand-inspired footer designs, each with its own unique layout, style, and personality — purely with HTML5 & CSS3 (plus a pinch of icons and fonts).

🌟 Highlights
✅ Brand-Inspired Designs — Footers from tech giants, e-commerce platforms, lifestyle brands, and creative tools
✅ Responsive Layouts — Looks perfect on desktop, tablet, and mobile
✅ Multiple Patterns — Minimal, multi-column, dark themes, and vibrant brand layouts
✅ Accessible & Semantic — Clean HTML structure with ARIA support
✅ Customizable — Colors, typography, and layouts easily adaptable
