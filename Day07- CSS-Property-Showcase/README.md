# 🎨 Day07 – CSS Property Showcase

This project is part of my **100 Days 100 Projects** challenge. On **Day 7**, I built a comprehensive visual guide to core CSS properties.

This project demonstrates how different CSS properties affect layout, design, and user interaction — all in one clean, responsive page.

## 🔍 Features Covered

- ✅ Typography: font size, weight, style, text transform, spacing, alignment
- ✅ Box Model: margin, padding, border, box-sizing
- ✅ Flexbox Layout: responsive horizontal layout
- ✅ Grid Layout: modern CSS grid structure
- ✅ Positioning: relative and absolute positioning
- ✅ Hover Effects: transitions and transform
- ✅ Transform: scale and rotation animations

## 🧠 Purpose

To give developers — especially beginners — a **hands-on demo** of how CSS brings static HTML to life. Think of this as a **CSS visual dictionary**.

## 📁 Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (no external libraries)
